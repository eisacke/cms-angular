This app is built on MongoDB, Angular, Express and Node.
In order to run it make sure that you have MongoDB installed, and are able to run `mongod` in a terminal window. You will also need to have installed Node. 

You should run `npm install` to download dependencies, and then run `node app.js` or `nodemon` if you have that installed, and visit http://localhost:3000.
